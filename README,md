A recycling plant management system
1. they have a set of materials(can be custom added,removed etc and price can be set)
2. when they are buying items they can click on item and weight this will show the calculated price but they can change the total price as needed
3. many items can be bought within a transaction
4. when buying things I can tag the supplier name(not mandatroty)
5. for suppliers i can collect name,phone number
6. I need separate tab called expenses where I can add the expenses (for expenses description(optional),amount and Tag(can be created or chosen from already created)
7. two hardcoded users 1.super admin and 2.normal admin(normal admin can only add records cant delete them

for now we will use react,express/nodejs and mongodb and once things are finalized we can do it with postgreqsql
